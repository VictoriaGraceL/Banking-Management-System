üîß Technical Details
Architecture Patterns

Inheritance: All account types extend the abstract Account class
Polymorphism: Different account types implement their own fee and interest rules
Encapsulation: Private fields with public getter/setter methods
GUI Design: Swing components with event-driven programming

Key Classes
Account (Abstract)

Base class defining common account properties
Abstract methods for applyMonthlyFee() and addInterest()
Common operations: deposit, withdraw, balance inquiry

AccountManager

Centralized account management
Account storage using ArrayList
Batch operations for fees and interest

GUI Classes

Main: Primary application window and navigation
CreateAccount: Account registration form
Login: Authentication interface
AccountMenu: Individual account management dashboard
